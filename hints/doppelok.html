        The idea here is that you need to make sure that you walk the row with a specific step. For example, you can use a loop or list comprehensions.

        We will use a list generator and several functions for our solution.

        Let's write a regular list comprehension, which we will modify. In this list comprehension, we will simply iterate over the given list.

        <pre class="brush: python">
a = [i for i in items]
        </pre>
    </div>

        Two functions range() and len() will help us to iterate through the list with a specific step. The range()
        function can accept as arguments (counting start, end, step). We choose 0 as the beginning, the end will
        be the length of the list (that is, we will use the len() function), and the step will be our size.
        The beginning of the list comprehension will also change, it will now add elements by index in the list.
        <pre class="brush: python">
a = [items[i] for i in range(0, len(items), size)]
        </pre>
    </div>

        We need to add the final upgrade to our list comprehension. Now we add only the first, fourth and seventh
        elements to the list (remember that the numbering starts with 0, not 1). Therefore, we will add the
        code that will add elements from - to.
        <pre class="brush: python">
a = [items[i:i+size] for i in range(0, len(items), size)]
        </pre>

        All you have to do is wrap the code in a function expression and return our list comprehension.
        <pre class="brush: python">
from typing import Iterable


def chunking_by(items: list, size: int) -> Iterable:
    return [items[i:i+size] for i in range(0, len(items), size)]
        </pre>
    </div>

        Okay, okay! That's the spirit!=)
        Option to solve the mission using a for loop and a yield expression. Such a function is also considered a generator by itself.
        <pre class="brush: python">
from typing import Iterable


def chunking_by(items: list, size: int) -> Iterable:
    for i in range(0, len(items), size):
        yield items[i:i + size]
        </pre>
    </div>
